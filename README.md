The goal of this project is to use imaging measures of the brain to predict a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adolescents, while also identifying features that may relate specifically to female or gender-influenced brain patterns. The objective is not only to build accurate predictive models, but also to explore meaningful brain differences that may diverge from traditionally understood norms, especially in underrepresented populations.
